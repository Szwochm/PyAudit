# PythonIDR-Scripts
I am currently on a journey to learn about Incidence Response. These Python scripts are created with the intent to help an Analyst quickly gather information from logs, pcaps, events, etc 

**dupMacs.py**

Notes: Needs to be  tested. Only programmed to catch duplicate ips sent via TCP. I should expand it to ARP, UDP at a minimum in the future

**Usage:** python dupMacs.py --pcap example-01.pcap
